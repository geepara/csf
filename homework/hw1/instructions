Build program:

  make

Run using:

  ./fixedpoint_tests

A minimum expectation of unit tests is that all public functions are tested. So, make sure that all of the functions declared in fixedpoint.h are tested.

We recommend that you use two uint64_t values in the representation of Fixedpoint, one to represent the whole part, and one to represent the fractional part.

Note that you will also need to store a “tag” that keeps track of whether the Fixedpoint value is valid/non-negative, valid/negative, an error value, an positive or negative overflow value, or a positive or negative underflow value.

valgrind --leak-check=full ./fixedpoint_tests

gdb ./fixedpoint_tests
